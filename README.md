# Requirement Analysis Project

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of **understanding, gathering, and defining** what a software system should do. It involves identifying the needs and expectations of stakeholders ‚Äî such as users, clients, and developers ‚Äî to ensure the final product meets its intended purpose.

In simple terms, requirement analysis answers the question:  
üëâ *‚ÄúWhat problem are we trying to solve, and what should the solution be able to do?‚Äù*

### Importance in the Software Development Cycle

Requirement analysis is a **critical first step** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all other phases. Without a clear understanding of requirements, the entire project risks failure, scope creep, or miscommunication between teams.

#### Key Benefits:
1. **Clarity of Goals:** It defines the purpose and objectives of the project clearly.  
2. **Prevents Misunderstanding:** Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of the system.  
3. **Improves Design & Planning:** Helps developers and designers make better technical decisions.  
4. **Reduces Cost & Rework:** Detecting issues early prevents expensive corrections later.  
5. **Enhances Quality:** Leads to a more reliable and user-friendly final product.  

### Conclusion
Requirement analysis acts as the **blueprint** of a software project.  
A well-documented requirement analysis ensures that development aligns with business goals and user needs ‚Äî leading to successful, high-quality software.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of any software project. It helps teams clearly understand the problem to be solved and guides the development process from start to finish.

Below are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Rework
By gathering and documenting all requirements before development begins, teams reduce misunderstandings between stakeholders, developers, and clients. This minimizes costly rework, saving both time and resources.

### 2. Ensures Project Alignment with Business Goals
Requirement analysis ensures that the software being developed directly addresses the business needs and user expectations. It aligns technical solutions with strategic objectives, ensuring the final product delivers real value.

### 3. Improves Quality and User Satisfaction
A thorough requirement analysis ensures that the system is designed to meet functional and non-functional needs. This leads to higher-quality software that performs efficiently and provides a better user experience.

### Summary
In essence, requirement analysis is the **foundation of successful software development**. Without it, projects risk failure due to unclear goals, scope creep, and poor communication.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured activities that help teams understand what needs to be built, why it‚Äôs needed, and how it should function.  
Below are the five key activities involved:

- **1. Requirements Gathering**  
  This is the process of collecting information from various stakeholders such as clients, users, and business managers. The goal is to understand their needs, expectations, and the problems the software should solve.

- **2. Requirements Elicitation**  
  In this stage, techniques such as interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, workshops, and observation are used to draw out deeper insights from stakeholders.  
  Elicitation ensures hidden or unclear requirements are uncovered early.

- **3. Requirements Documentation**  
  After gathering and eliciting requirements, they are clearly documented in a structured format (e.g., Software Requirements Specification ‚Äî SRS).  
  This document serves as a reference for the entire project team throughout development.

- **4. Requirements Analysis and Modeling**  
  Here, the collected requirements are analyzed to check for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.  
  Models such as flowcharts, use-case diagrams, and data models may be created to visualize system behavior and interactions.

- **5. Requirements Validation**  
  This activity ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholders‚Äô needs.  
  It involves reviews, walkthroughs, and feedback sessions to confirm correctness and feasibility before development begins.

### Summary
These five activities form the **core of requirement analysis**, ensuring that the project is well-understood, properly planned, and aligned with user and business objectives.




## Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are broadly categorized into **Functional** and **Non-Functional Requirements**.  
Both types are essential for building a complete and reliable system.

### 1. Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe *what the system should do*.  
They define the specific behaviors, features, and functions of the software ‚Äî how the system should respond to inputs and produce outputs.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- The system should allow users to **create, view, and cancel bookings**.  
- The system should enable administrators to **approve or reject booking requests**.  
- Users should receive **email or SMS notifications** upon successful booking or cancellation.  
- The system should allow users to **search for available slots** based on date and time.  
- The system should provide a **login and authentication** feature for both users and administrators.

---

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements describe *how the system performs its functions*.  
They focus on quality attributes like performance, usability, security, and reliability rather than specific behaviors.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- The system should **load the booking page within 3 seconds** under normal conditions.  
- The application should be **available 99.9% of the time** (high reliability).  
- User data must be **encrypted** to ensure privacy and security.  
- The interface should be **responsive and accessible** on both mobile and desktop devices.  
- The system should support **up to 10,000 concurrent users** without performance degradation.

---

### Summary
Functional requirements define **what** the system does,  
while Non-functional requirements define **how well** it does it.  
Both are vital to ensure that the Booking Management Project is effective, efficient, and user-friendly.
